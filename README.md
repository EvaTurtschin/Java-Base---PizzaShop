Java Base Course Task:

Create a pizza store/factory for selling and producing pizzas. The program should be able to prepare the following types of pizza:

Hawaii
Margherita
Salami

Each type of pizza should be able to: be prepared (apply toppings), be baked, and be packaged. In each case, it should be clear which pizza is being referred to.

In the OnlinePizzaShop class, no new pizza object should be created. Instead, an "order" for the required type of pizza (object) should be sent to the PizzaChoice class, which should then select the necessary pizza for production.

The selection of pizza is made by the customer via keyboard input in the OnlinePizzaShop class. Additionally, ensure validation of the customer's choice and the ability to order more pizzas.
